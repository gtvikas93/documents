Incorrect Bank Amount Transfers: Classification and the Prevalence of Beneficiary Detail Errors
Incorrect bank amount transfers represent a significant challenge in modern financial systems, 
often resulting in financial losses, operational inefficiencies, and legal complications. 
Among these errors, transactions involving incorrect beneficiary details—particularly account numbers 
and IFSC codes—are a predominant cause of misdirected funds. 
Studies indicate that approximately 25% of individuals have erroneously transferred funds to unintended recipients due to input errors, 
with 6.01% of non-reversal cases in banking systems directly linked to incorrect beneficiary details. 
This report examines the classification of incorrect transfers, analyzes the prevalence of beneficiary-related errors, 
and explores mitigation strategies within the framework of banking regulations and technological advancements.
